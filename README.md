# Van-ijya
This project (Vaańijya – Trade and Commerce) allows one to explore the latest trends and entries into the market in various fields like cars and automobiles, Men and Women fashion, sports, etc. It is an online shopping platform designed in Tkinter and developed using the python language and a MySQL database. There are various categories available from which one can search for a particular product (search bar also available) and add it to their cart. Each product is attached with its detailed description and retail price. One can view their cart and ask for the final bill at any point of time. To help with any difficulties in understanding the user interface, a ‘help’ button is provided in the application which will guide the user appropriately.
The features we would like to further develop in our project is the deletion of a particular product from the cart and a one-click selection to add the product into the cart.
